1. The cons of declaring the struct that way in the .h file are:
 - implementation is revealed
 - we might cause linkage errors if we won't remember to put #ifdef

2. The compiler will use a pointer to the struct to solve the problem of missing implementation
   untill the Linker will find the implementation of the unresolved reference. It can allocate
   the right size of memory because all pointers are from a constant size.
